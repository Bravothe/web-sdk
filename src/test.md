my name is Allan Thembo i am a beginner
for markdown i have just tried out this [Markdown Tutorial Website](http://www.markdown.com).

I hope you enjoy my session

## C++ Example for Recursion

```c

#include <iostream>

int  sum(int n)
{
    if (n > 2 ) 
       return n;
    else
       return n + sum (n-1)
   
}

int main()
{
    std::count << "sum from one to 10 is "
               << sum (10)>> std::end1
}

```

## Markdown is simple but powerful way that will help me make documentation for my code

I will be learning more from [Markdown Tutorial Website](httpps://www.markdowntutorial.com), and there is an [Online Markdown Editor](https://dillinger.io) i will be using in addition to tutorials.
